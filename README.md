# Python-Challenge

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using the financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
