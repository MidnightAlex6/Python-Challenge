# Python-Challenge

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using the financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

•	The total number of months included in the dataset

•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My Final Analysis Come out to this:

In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

•	The total number of votes cast
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The total number of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote
Your analysis should align with the following results:
